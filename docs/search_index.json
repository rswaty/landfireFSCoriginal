It was written in R using R-Studio, the bookdown package and is hosted on GitHub(links to this repository). You are a guinea pig, the subject of an experiment. We hope you do not feel duped. Wed sincerely appreciate your feedback on the session, any ideas or edits you have for this document and questions you may have about what we do. Please e-mail use at landfire@tnc.org. The goals are to: get acres of ecosystems past and present explore ecosystem conversion compare amounts of succession classes past and present In the United States, including the insular areas, LANDFIRE provides the datasets and ecological model results to get at these challenges and more. Here we walk you through some of the technical steps needed to start your analysis. We will do our work in a model landscape, the Michigamme Highlands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (highlighted in green in map below). To help you with the concepts we work through pre-processed LANDFIRE data for an example landscape. To prepare the datasets for your landscape see the Appendix.

The largest nearby city is Marquette, MI, population 20,822 (2019). This ecoregion is ~757,000 acres (306380 hectares) and is know for its beautiful forests, rivers and lakes. It is underlain by sandstone, slate, shale and iron formations. Elevations range from around 600ft to almost 2,000 ft above sea level. The ecoregion has a humid continental climate with a growing season ranging from 75-150 days and average annual snowfall amounts reaching 200 inches in the higher terrain. Logging and mining have been the major industrial forces in the area. Both continue today, especially logging. Mining has transitioned from largely iron to primarily nickel. The area is of conservation interest due to the relatively high connectivity, large average land parcel size and projected climate change resiliency (see map below).

This dataset will be used to get at community habitat, or where ecosystems could occur based on abiotic factors (e.g., soils, climate and natural disturbance regimes). Succession classes characterize structural classes on the landscape at the time the dataset represents (e.g., 2016 for LF Version 200). Existing Vegetation Type maps NatureServes Ecological Systems (see descriptions here). Non-spatial products Biophysical Settings Descriptions which has information on natural disturbance regimes and succession class descriptions (also available here). Reference Condition Table supplements the BpS descriptions with the reference percentages for each succession class, for each Biophysical Settings. 3.3 Guidance on obtaining LANDFIRE products There are multiple ways to get LANDFIRE products depending on whether you are looking to obtain BpS models and descriptions or the spatial data: For BpS models and descriptions go to: http://landfirereview.org/search.php. Start by clicking on the View map of LANDFIRE Map Zones. This will help you narrow down your search. Alternatively, you can wait to download BpS descriptions until you do some GIS work and get specific names of BpSs of interest. For the spatial datasets you can explore options here which include: Downloading Full Extent Mosaics. When you do use this option you get large files that cover the entire lower 48, AK or HI (depending on your selection). We use this method when we have several landscapes and/or a large area and no computer storage issues. Using the LANDFIRE Data Distribution Site. With this method you essentially select the datasets you need then draw a rectangle (or you can select state or counties) around your area of interest to start the downloader. We recommend this if your area of interest is not too large and/or you have a low number of landscapes and/or have storage limits. "],["historicalEcosystems.html", "4 Historical Ecosystems 4.1 General methods 4.2 Getting at amounts of historical ecosystems", " 4 Historical Ecosystems In this chapter we will learn which ecosystems, and how much of each were on our landscape historically. 4.1 General methods In this section (and most others) we will depend on Pivot Tables in Excel. They are powerful (for better or worse!) tools that allow for tasks such as: organization and formatting of data calculations filtering data nesting data With the power comes the call for caution. It is super easy to display values that look illuminating-but may be wrong. You can easily be duped into complacency, especially when working in the value field settings. 4.1.1 A few potential traps with Pivot Tables Pivot Tables allow you to calculate, summarize, format and analyze datasets. There are a few traps we run into frequently that are worth mentioning here: Your Pivot Table controls go away. This happens when you click outside of the main Pivot Table area (where your values are, usually on the left side of screen). To fix this click inside one of the Pivot Table columns. Another way to fix this is to right click inside a Pivot Table cell and select Show field list. Miscalculating. This typically happens when you are in the Value Field Settings pane and select the wrong Show values as option. The key here is to visually inspect the results to make sure you have made the correct selection. You want to remove totals and subtotals without having to delete them all. To fix this and many formatting issues click anywhere inside of the Pivot Table -&gt; Click Design from the top ribbon -&gt; click the Subtotals drop down -&gt; click Do Not Show Subtotals. Repeat for Grand Totals. While you are there, explore the Report Layout and Blank Rows drop downs. 4.2 Getting at amounts of historical ecosystems Start by opening the historical tab in the Excel workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields pane, select BPS_NAME then ACRES. Right click in the top cell of the Sum of ACRES column (not the column header) in the Pivot Table, then Sort Largest to Smallest. In our example we have some BpSs that have low ACRES values. We also have categories that are not meaningful, such as Barren-Rock/Sand/Clay. We can do a little formatting/cleaning before making a chart: To remove BpSs from the table you will click the drop-down menu to the right of BPS_NAME in the Pivot Table Fields pane. You can uncheck BpSs as appropriate. It is also possible to filter by right clicking on the top value in the list of BpSs, then selecting Filter &gt; Top 10. Once in that menu you can refine the filtering. To get percentages, drag ACRES from the top Pivot Table Field pane to the Values pane. This will add a second ACRES column to the table. Click the drop down in the second instance of ACRES (reads SUM of ACRES2 in our example), then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % of Grand Total% to get percentages of each BpS (make sure thatBPS_NAME\" is selected as the Base field). To get a running total of percentages you will add a third instance of ACRES to the Values pane, then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % Running Total In to get running totals of percentages of each BpS (make sure that BPS_NAME is selected as the Base field). Save! Example output Below is essentially the output from our Pivot Table work with a couple changes: Names have been shortened for ease of reading Numbers have been rounded We see that the top 4 BpSs comprised ~80% of our example landscape historically. We can visually confirm this and other patterns with a quick chart made in R (similar charts available in Excel by highlighting the data, clicking Insert then selecting the chart type in the Charts tab): "],["evt.html", "5 Existing Vegetation Types 5.1 General methods 5.2 Getting at amounts of current ecosystems", " 5 Existing Vegetation Types While looking at the historical ecosystems gives context, we also need to get a picture of which ecosystems are on the landscape today. 5.1 General methods We use the same general methods as we did on the Historical Ecosystems page, using a Pivot Table. We rely on LANDFIREs Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) data for this assessment. 5.2 Getting at amounts of current ecosystems Start by opening the current tab in the Excel workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields pane, select EVT_NAME then ACRES. Make sure that EVT_NAME is in the Rows pane, and that Sum of ACRES is in the Values pane. Right click in the top cell of the Sum of ACRES column (not the column header) in the Pivot Table, then Sort Largest to Smallest. In our example we have some BpSs that have low ACRES values. We also have categories that are not meaningful, such as Barren-Rock/Sand/Clay. We can do a little formatting/cleaning before making a chart: To remove EVTs from the table you will click the drop-down menu to the right of BPS_NAME in the Pivot Table Fields pane. You can uncheck BpSs as appropriate. It is also possible to filter by right clicking on the top value in the list of EVTs within the Pivot Table, then selecting Filter &gt; Top 10. Once in that menu you can refine the filtering. Additionally we like to add commas and remove decimal places. To do this right click the row that contains Sum of ACRES in the spreadsheet (likely row B), select Format Cells &gt; Number &gt; set Decimal places to 0 then check the \"Use 1000 Separator box. To get percentages, drag ACRES from the top Pivot Table Field pane to the Values pane. This will add a second ACRES column to the table. Click the drop down in the second instance of ACRES (reads SUM of ACRES2 in our example), then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % of Grand Total% to get percentages of each BpS (make sure thatBPS_NAME\" is selected as the Base field). To get a running total of percentages you will add a third instance of ACRES to the Values pane, then Value Field Settings. In this menu select the Show Values As tab, click the Show Values As drop down then select % Running Total In to get running totals of percentages of each BpS (make sure that BPS_NAME is selected as the Base field). Save! Example output Below is essentially the output from our Pivot Table work with a couple changes: Names have been shortened for ease of reading Numbers have been rounded We see that first there are many EVTs. This partially due to the addition of Developed and other modern categories such as Recently Logged-Tree Cover. Second we see that of the natural types their is a close match with the historical. We can visually confirm this and other patterns with a quick chart made in R (similar charts available in Excel by highlighting the data, clicking Insert then selecting the chart type in the Charts tab): "],["conversion.html", "6 Exploring conversion 6.1 The fine print 6.2 Pivot table work 6.3 Visual exploration for fun.", " 6 Exploring conversion The main question we explore on this page: how much of the historic ecosystems have been converted to a different land use (e.g., agriculture). 6.1 The fine print While this assessment is illustrative, it is important to note that the methods used to create the BpS and EVT datasets are substantially different, and LANDFIRE datasets are not made for assessing small areas. Please review. In the exercise we will focus on the coarsest classifications. If you need to work at the finer classification levels proceed with caution! 6.2 Pivot table work Working in the Conversion worksheet: Check the GROUPVEG then the EVT_PHYS fields to add them to the Pivot Table. Make sure that GROUPVEG is the leftmost column. If not drag that field to the top in the Rows pane. In the cell above the GROUPVEG field header type past; in the cell above the EVT_PHYS type present. If you fancy click the dropdown in the GROUPVEG header. Here you can remove types. Lets remove Barren-Rock/Sand/Clay. Check the ACRES field to add it to the Pivot Table. Explore. Of what was historically mapped as CONIFER, whats the biggest non-CONIFER type today? Switch the order of the fields by dragging EVT_PHYS to the top of the Rows pane. Which GROUPVEG type was most converted to Developed? 6.3 Visual exploration for fun. Sometimes patterns emerge from visuals. Below is a Sankey Diagram generated in R (can also be created in Excel we hear. See instructions here). On the left are the historical ecosystems, on the right current ecosystems and flow bands. The width of the bands is proportional to the flow rate. Some potential interpretations, partially based on the chart, partially based on local knowledge: There is more northern hardwoods mapped today than historically. This could be due to simplification of ecosystems that have some shared species. For example, many conifers have been removed and deer present a challenge for regeneration. One hypothesis would be that due to logging and deer the Pine-Hemlock-Hardwood-Forest has been essentially converted to Northern Hardwoods. It might be more illuminating to group some types together, such as the Recently Logged types. LANDFIRE has mapped potential change of the wetlands to other types. This could be due to mapping errors, or due to alterations in hydrology because of roads perhaps. More investigation is warranted. Click here to view diagram in your web browser. "],["successionClasses.html", "7 Succession Classes 7.1 What we will do here 7.2 What are Succession Classes? 7.3 Our sample ecosystem 7.4 Your tasks", " 7 Succession Classes 7.1 What we will do here While looking at conversion of historical ecosystems is valuable, we can dig deeper, comparing amounts historical succession classes to current. This gives us a broad measure of the changes in vegetation structure for ecosystems. 7.2 What are Succession Classes? In general LANDFIRE succession classes are stages of development defined in the descriptions of each Biophysical Setting. They are characterized by vegetation height, canopy cover and to some degree species composition. Key takeaways: To learn what the succession classes are for each Biophysical Setting you look to the corresponding description on http://landfirereview.org/test/search.php LANDFIRE used state and transition models to estimate the amount of each succession class that would occur with natural (pre-European colonization) disturbance regimes. Historical succession classes were not mapped as they were assumed to move around over time. The Succession Class dataset maps the current location of succession classes, in addition to agricultural and developed land-use classes plus uncharacteristic vegetation. Uncharacteristic typically represents exotic vegetation, or vegetation structure that would not have occured historically. By comparing the amounts of historical and current succession classes you can get a sense of which classes are over/under represented. This assumes that the landscape you are assessing is large enough to potentially include the full compliment of succession classes. 7.3 Our sample ecosystem To illustrate the concept of comparing reference to current succession classes we will focus on the Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods-Hemlock Biophysical Setting. It is a dominant ecosystem in the Michigamme Highlands, has been heavily managed and faces many threats such as deer browsing. 7.4 Your tasks We will start with our friend the Pivot Table to get current percentages of the relevant succession classes, then we will look to the Biophysical Settings descriptions to get historical percentages. 7.4.1 Current succession classes Open the successionClasses worksheet in our combineClean.xlsx workbook. In the Pivot Table Fields box highlight BPS_MODEL -&gt; click the down arrow -&gt; select only Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest - Hemlock. Check the box next to BPS_NAME. In the Pivot Table Fields check the box next to LABEL to get a list of current succession classes. In the Pivot Table Fields check the box next to ACRES. In the Values pane click the doww arrow -&gt; select Value Field Settings. Once the Value field settings are open click Show Values As -&gt; select % of Grand Total from the dropdown list. Copy the resultant table -&gt; paste next to the Pivot Table in the same worksheet -&gt; add column names Succession class and Current. 7.4.2 Historical succession classes Open the NorthernHardwoodsHemlock.docx document that is in the toDownload zipped folder. Skim through the document to get a sense of the ecosystem, paying particular attention to the Succession Classes section. There are be 5 succession classes, A, B, C, D and E with corresponding estimated reference amounts. For example, Succession Class A was modeled to be rare in this ecosystem that did not have much fire. LANDFIRE estimated that only 1% of this ecosystem would have been Succession Class a historically. Back in the pivot table, you will create a new column named Historical, then type the succession class percentages from the document into the corresponding row. Now we can start to see some patterns emerge. We wont spoil your fun by saying what those patterns are! "],["gisPrep.html", "8 APPENDIX 8.1 GIS Prep: Combine data 8.2 GIS Prep: Join in attributes 8.3 GIS Prep:Clean data table", " 8 APPENDIX 8.1 GIS Prep: Combine data Once spatial data is properly projected and clipped to area of interest, perform a combine in ArcMap (Toolbox &gt; Spatial Analyst &gt; Local &gt; Combine) of the BpS, SCL and EVT datasets. Alternatively, you can combine a raster of the area of interest with those 3 datasets which are stored as larger extents (like shown below). 8.2 GIS Prep: Join in attributes There are multiple ways-we recommend using the Join Field tool (Toolbox &gt; data management tools &gt; joins &gt; add join). One reason to do this is to be able to select which fields to join in. A potential resulting table looks like this for a landscape in Michigan (with minimal cleaning/formatting): As is this table does not mean too much-we will need to do some cleaning, formatting and calculating. 8.3 GIS Prep:Clean data table You will first need to save the combined .csv file file as an .xlsx file so that you can have multiple worksheets. We recommend keeping the original output as a raw spreadsheet in Excel, pasting that data into a new sheet and working with that new sheet moving forward. * It is OK to remove the US_200BPS, US_200EVT, and US_200SCLASS columns * Rename some columns: GROUPVEG to BPSGROUPVEG; EVT_PHYS to EVTGROUPVEG; LABEL to SUCCESSIONCLASS, or similar as needed for clarity * COUNT = number of 30m x 30m pixels for that combination of BpS-EVT-SCLS. Insert a column named ACRES, then calculate acres by multiplying COUNT by 0.222. Copy-Paste Values for that new column. Below is an example of what our new data table looks like. "]]
