This dataset will be used to get at community habitat, or where ecosystems could occur based on abiotic factors (e.g., soils, climate). Succession classes characterizes structural classes on the landscape at the time the dataset represents (e.g., 2016 for LF Version 200). Existing Vegetation Type maps NatureServes Ecological Systems (see descriptions here). Non-spatial products Biophysical Settings Descriptions which has information on natural disturbance regimes and succession class descriptions (also available here) Reference Condition Table supplements the BpS descriptions with the reference percentages for each succession class, for each Biophysical Settings. "],["gisPrep.html", "Chapter 3 GIS prep", " Chapter 3 GIS prep Methods: Once spatial data is clipped to area of interest, perform a combine in ArcMap (Toolbox &gt; Spatial Analyst &gt; Local &gt; Combine) of the BpS, SCL and EVT datasets. Alternatively, you can combine a raster of the area of interest with those 3 datasets which are stored as larger extents (like shown below). Join in attributes. There are multiple ways-we recommend using the Join Field tool (Toolbox &gt; data management tools &gt; joins &gt; add join). One reason to do this is to be able to select which fields to join in. A potential resulting table looks like this for a landscape in Michigan (with minimal cleaning/formatting): As is this table does not mean too much-we will need to do some cleaning, formatting and calculating. Clean data table (combined .csv file). You will first need to save this file as an .xlsx file so that you can have multiple worksheets. We recommend keeping the original output as a raw spreadsheet in Excel, pasting that data into a new sheet and working with that new sheet moving forward. It is OK to remove the US_200BPS, US_200EVT, and US_200SCLASS columns Rename some columns: GROUPVEG to BPSGROUPVEG; EVT_PHYS to EVTGROUPVEG; LABEL to SUCCESSIONCLASS, or similar as needed for clarity COUNT = number of 30m x 30m pixels for that combination of BpS-EVT-SCLS. Insert a column named ACRES, then calculate acres by multiplying COUNT by 0.222. Copy-Paste Values for that new column. Below is an example of what our new data table looks like.
